## Strings
If you are looking at these pictures you might be wondering what this is...
Well for the 49th Security Division @wonkeymonkey created a script that would hide words inside of .png files

So if you execute the strings command on the first file 
```
strings meme1.png
```

Then you should see a "Hello World!" in the output of the text.

## Opening
When opening this file some image editors are better than others and if the file is corrupted it won't open.
Just to be safe (if your default image viewer doesn't work) you can use ocular and winview in linux.

### First File
This file isn't too bad, because it only has the small amount of text at teh very end. 

### Second File
This one looks bad, if you look the whole bottom part of the image is messed up. Very noticable!
